Change log for fselect, the full-screen file selection utility.

1.0	not yet ;)
	- initial public release.

1.0.1rc - added time.h where it was missing and impeding me from trying fselect.
	- added a one shot key: pressing . you can mark the file you're selecting and exit immediately,
	  with the file printed to standard output.
	- added two function that gave me warnings in compilation.
